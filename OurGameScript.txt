SCRIPT1:
Hi 
I found this phone here with your number as the only contact
I've been kidnapped and locked in a room I'm not familiar with
Someone was just asking me for directions and next thing you know I'm in this room
I need your help in escaping this room before the kidnapper kills me
> Hello
> How do you know the kidnapper's going to kill you?
I found a note beside the phone that says I have a limited time before he kills me
He didnt say how much time I've got so I have to get out of here fast!
I'm feelings chills down my spine and I don't know where to start looking for a way out of this room...

CHOICES: go near the portrait, go near the bookshelf, check the plants, go to coffee table, come closer to the door

SCRIPT2: (bookshelf)
There's all sorts of books here, from children's books to professional books
There are also novels like Harry Potter, the Percy Jackson series, The Kite Runner, Catcher in the Rye and Number the Stars
But the ones that stand out and looks like it's been read multiple times are A Study in Scarlet, The Hound of Baskervilles, and Hamlet

CHOICES: check a study in scarlet, check the hound of baskervilles, check hamlet, go back to table

SCRIPT3:
I pulled out The Hound of Baskervilles and it opened to a page with highlights on "That which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed."
What does this even mean?
Ohh wait... A note fell down: "" 
(add word puzzle)

CHOICES: continue searching bookshelf, enter solution, go back to table

SCRIPT4:
(puzzle solved, give small key to safe under pot)

CHOICES: continue searching bookshelf, go back to table

SCRIPT5:
No, that doesn't seem to work

CHOICES: continue searching bookshelf, enter solution, go back to table

SCRIPT6:
Nothing significant about this book except that it's about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson

CHOICES: continue searching bookshelf, go back to table

SCRIPT7:
I opened Hamlet and it went to a page with highlights on "One may smile, and smile, and be a villain."
This sounds like a hidden note that the kidnapper left me and I'm scared...

CHOICES: continue searching bookshelf, go back to table

SCRIPT8: (plants)
I see a Peace Lily, an Areca Palm, Birds of Paradise, and a small Bamboo plant
I can't recognize the others though
Something smells nice but I can't figure out where its coming from

CHOICES: check bottom of pots, go back to table

SCRIPT9:
I found where the smell's coming from! Yey!
It's from a scented paper hidden under one of the pots
The paper states: "Current code: Take this number, add twelve twice, add 6 thrice, and get 52, nice"
Huh? I don't understand...
Ohh wait... There's a hidden safe right where I got the paper
Now how do I open this?

CHOICES: enter code, go back to table
(correct code = 10)

SCRIPT10:
Yes! It opened!
Pssh...I knew that was the answer, I was just checking if you know it too
Amazing! There's a small box hidden here!
It sounds like it has something inside it
But how do I open this? There's no passcode needed or something of the like

(use key if checked the book Hound)
CHOICES: (use key), go back to table

SCRIPT11:
So that was the use of the key! 
Who would have thought that that small key can be used for something in this room

(small box opened containing PROOF of relationship with kidnapper)

CHOICES: go back to table

SCRIPT12: (coffee table)
There's a cup of coffee here
It's still a bit warm, I wonder if the kidnapper will come back for this
There's a chair right beside the table
Wait... Let me check it out...
Ohh wow! It's a recliner and made of genuine leather!
I wonder if my kidnapper is rich since he was able to afford this

CHOICES: recline the chair, go back to table

SCRIPT13:
Wow! It's sooo comfortable!
This makes me want to read a book or sleep
I know I shouldn't though so let me unrecline this chair
Huh? What's this under the handle?
(insert puzzle)

CHOICES: enter solution, go back to table

SCRIPT14:
Incorrest solution

CHOICES: enter solution, go back to table

SCRIPT15:
Correct solution

CHOICES: go back to table

SCRIPT16: (portrait)
It looks like an image of the Abduction of Psyche
I love Greek and Roman mythology so I can tell that this is Cupid and Psyche
Ohh how I love the story of what Cupid did for his loved one
Despite the choices Psyche did, Cupid kept on loving and helping her all through-out
Maybe the kidnapper also likes their story...

CHOICES: try to take it off, go back to table, check broken tile

SCRIPT17:
*creaking sounds*
Ahah! There's a broken tile by my foot
It looks like it's been deliberately removed as if to hide something important
Hmm...
I was right! There's a note here: 
"If 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 7 = 17, 4 + 5 = 19 and 5 + 8 = 37, then what number between 40 and 50 is 6 + 7?"
(broken tile with clue to code of vault behind portrait)

CHOICES: try to take it off, go back to table, check broken tile

SCRIPT18:
(take off portrait)
(see safe behind it)

CHOICES: enter code, go back to table

SCRIPT 19:
(safe opened)
